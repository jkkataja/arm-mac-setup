## Setup
Just get 'em files and do your adjustments.

The function "require" doesn't actually **require** the file to exists so don't worry about it.

I personally like to symlink the files from my homefolder to the actual folder containing the files, e.g., `ln -s zsh/rc/zlogin .zlogin`. That way it's easy for you to stop using this setup.
